MobiVoteVerifier
================

MobiVoteVerifier is a verification application for MobiVote. MobiVote is
an Android application for Boardroom voting. It allows spontaneous
verifiable and secure e-voting for a small group of people present at

MobiVote allows to export the cryptographic report of an election. This
report can be verified with MobiVoteVerifier, which again checks each
step of the election. So, if you don't trust your mobile device, you can
do a verification on your computer. MobiVoteVerifier also allows to
check multiple reports from different voters to check if everybody came
to the same election result. MobiVoteVerifier and MobiVote use the same
code base.
